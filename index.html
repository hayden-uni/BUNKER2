            <div class="hobbitimg">
                <img src="Images/hobbit_home_1.jpg" alt= "A Hobbit style house built 
                into the side of a hill with a yellow door"/>
            </div>

         <p><em>Is this really Frodo's home?</em> , silly, this is just a stock image
            of a really lovely Hobbit Home located in New Zealand. However if it 
            was Frodo's home, that would be really impressive.</p>
        
        <p>In the books Frodo and gang meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bombadil">Tom Bombadil</a> who can wear The Ring without disappearing or being 
            tempted by it. How does that work you say? Perhaps he's older than the trees. 
            Maybe he's magic. Either way, if the council handed Tom the ring, he would have 
            just thrown it away and carried on with his business of being older than the acorns. </p>

            <h2>Bilbo's Home</h2>
            <div class="hobbitimg">
                <img src="Images/hobbit_home_2.jpg" alt= "A Hobbit home built into a 
                hill with a dashing blue door"/>
            </div>

         <p>This isn't Bilbo's house either, but it really looks like it could be.
            And that blue door, a nice touch I would say. As many people know, 
            Bilbo wrote a book about his adventures and when he found the ring that 
            basically ruined his life and his cousin's life as well (yes, they were 
            cousin's and not uncle / nephew). Bla bla bla, <strong> yes, he saved the world from
            total evil and darkness,</strong>but kinda got a bum deal out of it. Here's a riddle 
            from his meeting with Gollum.<blockquote>A box without hinges, key or lid, Yet golden 
            treasure inside is hid. <b>Answer: Egg.</b></blockquote></p>

        <p>Alright, alright yeah yeah. He and Frodo got to go live with the Elves and
             ride on that boat, so maybe not totally a ruined life.</p>

            <h2>Peregrin's Home</h2>
            <div class="hobbitimg">
                <img src="Images/hobbit_home_3.jpg" alt="A Hobbit style cabin, built into
                a hill but significantly smaller than the other houses"/>
            </div>

         <p>You know after all his adventures, I could see Peregrin living
            in a tiny home such as this one, but I would expect he might want to 
            paint his door maybe a different colour. My first dog was named Pippin,
            after Peregrin Took. He became the 32nd Thane of the Shire for 50 years. 
            Well done, Pippin.</p>

            <div class="hobbitimg">
                <img src="Images/hobbit_home_4.jpg" alt= "A cozy Hobbit home built into a
                hill, but fashioned like an actual tree"/>
            </div>

         <p>Oh Meriadoc, a kind soul and the most perceptive of the group 
            of Hobbit's that found themselves on a journey. Because he and 
            Pippin drank a ton of Entwater, they ended up being the talles
            Hobbit's when they returned back to The Shire. This made them 
            fine catches and ended up marrying beautiful Hobbit ladies. Oh lala!</p>

            <h2>Sam's Home</h2>
            <div class="hobbitimg">
                <img src="Images/hobbit_home_5.jpg" alt="A triangular cabin on the seafront,
                looking over a vast lake"/>
            </div>

         <p>Sam was Frodo's Gardener and his best friend. He always, I mean 
            ALWAYS had something to say about everything.<blockquote> "I know we are going 
            to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. 
            It isn't to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want 
            â€œ I don't rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before the 
            end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire." </blockquote><em>Sure.</em></p>
        
         <p>Without Sam, we would all have been eaten by Uruk-hai. I do appreciate his 
            determination and support to our wary hero. And found it great that ultimately
            he ended up dating <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Joyce_Byers">
            Joyce Byers</a> and again showing how brave and loyal he was. I guess being 
            a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ2j4oWdQtU">Pirate Treasure Hunter</a> 
            to save his Pacific Northwest costal town from being sold to developers as a child 
            really shapes who you become as a grown-up. </p>

                reminiscent of seaside holiday homes"/>
            </div>

         <p>Who's that? I don't know, and he's a Sackville-Baggins,
            and we all know we don't give them the time of day.</p>
